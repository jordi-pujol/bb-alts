bb-alts.conf(5)
===============

Name
----

bb-alts.conf - configuration file for *bb-alts*

Description
-----------

The file */etc/bb-alts.conf* contains variables for the package 
*bb-alts*.

*/etc/bb-alts.conf* is sourced by a shell program.

Variables
---------

Specify various options to *bb-alts*, as described below.

  *BB_ALTS*::
is a list of candidate alternatives that the package *bb-alts* will 
consider for installing an alternative. It's recommended to install 
only alternatives that are also installed as alternatives by the other 
packages, therefore this variable contains the definitions for some 
Debian's well known alternatives.

  *USE_ALTS_EXTRA*::
Installing alternatives that may conflict with other packages is not 
recommended , but *bb-alts* will consider other installation candidates 
when the superuser configures some extra applet names in the variable 
*BB_ALTS_EXTRA* and sets the variable *USE_ALTS_EXTRA* to any non-blank 
value, after should reconfigure the package.

  *BB_ALTS_EXTRA*::
it's another list of candidate alternatives for *bb-alts* to install. 
This list contains extra alternatives to useful *busybox* applets that 
may conflict with executable files installed by other packages.

  *USE_ALTS_FOREIGN*::
It's possible to install alternatives to executables that are not 
*busybox* applets; *bb-alts* will do that when setting the variable 
*USE_ALTS_FOREIGN* to any non-blank value, and after reconfiguring the 
package.

  *BB_ALTS_FOREIGN*::
also it's another list of candidate alternatives for *bb-alts* to 
install. This list contains foreign alternatives to other executable 
programs that are not *busybox* applets. The alternatives configured in 
these way may not be correctly removed when updating or removing the 
*bb-alts* package, so the superuser must be aware of that.

  *PRIORITY*::
this configuration variable specifies default priority for all 
alternatives.

Alternative's format
--------------------

In the lists of candidate alternatives there are *alternative link 
groups* separated by space or newline.

An alternative's link group will install a master alternative and 
slaves, the members of a link group are separated by comma.

Generic format for the description of a link group of alternatives:

  master[,slave1]...[,slaveN]

Format of the master alternative:

  [/path/]name[:name][:target][:priority][:manpage]

Format of the slave alternatives:

  [/path/]name[:name][:target]

  [/path/]name::
is the location of an alternative. /path/ is optional for busybox 
applets. Must specify an absolute /path/name for non-internal busybox 
applets or to force the location of an alternative.

  name::
of the alternative, is optional,
default value is the basename of /path/name

  target::
is optional, default value is busybox. Is allowed any of the busybox 
applets or the other helper programs installed by the *bb-alts* 
package, also even other executable programs in the system.

  priority::
is the master alternative priority, optional

  manpage::
Optional parameter. It's the command name for the man page to use for 
this alternative. When there is no value then  *bb-alts* will use the 
busybox's one. When the manpage value is "?", *bb-alts* will search for 
a matching man page for that command. If the value is invalid, i.e. 
"-", then  *bb-alts* will not append an slave alternative for the 
man page.
