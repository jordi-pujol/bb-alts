Description
-----------
*bb-alts* is a package that installs alternatives to busybox internal 
utilities, adding some useful busybox utilities to the system.

Detects existing Debian alternatives from other packages and installs 
the corresponding busybox utility as another alternative, installing 
also man pages for each utility; man pages are linked to the *busybox* 
man page.

Before installing alternatives, *bb-alts* removes all alternatives that 
point to */bin/busybox* and also to the /usr/bin/\*-busybox executables 
installed by the *bb-alts* package.

The file */etc/bb-alts.conf* configures the candidate alternatives that 
*bb-alts* will consider for installing an alternative.

It's recommended to install only alternatives that are also installed 
as alternatives by the other packages. However *bb-alts* can install 
alternatives for any busybox applet, so we are able to install as 
Debian alternatives a lot of useful busybox utilities.

Some packages do not install Debian alternatives for some utilities 
that are also provided by busybox, in this case the alternatives 
installed by *bb-alts* may conflict with other files; therefore some 
problems may arise and the superuser must be aware of that.

*bb-alts* will not install an utility when there is already an 
executable file in the corresponding location.

Before installing a new package that provides an executable file on the 
same location that a busybox alternative, the superuser must remove the 
alternatives installed by *bb-alts*, let's execute: 
*bb-alts* --deconfigure ; therefore install the new package and 
reconfigure *bb-alts*.

On the other side, after removing a package that provides some utility 
that is also in busybox we must reconfigure *bb-alts*, that will 
install the corresponding alternatives activating the utility from the 
*busybox* internal applet.
