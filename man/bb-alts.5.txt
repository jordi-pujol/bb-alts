Description
-----------
*bb-alts* is a package that installs alternatives to busybox internal 
applets, allowing easy use of busybox commands in the system.

Detects existing Debian alternatives from other packages and installs 
the corresponding busybox utility as another alternative, installing 
also man pages for each utility; all man pages are linked to the 
*busybox* man page.

The file */etc/bb-alts.conf* configures the candidate alternatives that 
*bb-alts* will consider for installing an alternative.

When reconfiguring or upgrading the package *bb-alts* will save the 
previous status of the alternatives.

It's recommended to install only alternatives that are also installed 
as alternatives by the other packages. However *bb-alts* can install 
alternatives for any busybox applet, so we are able to install as 
Debian alternatives a lot of useful busybox utilities.

Some packages do not install Debian alternatives for some utilities 
that are also provided by busybox, in this case the alternatives 
installed by *bb-alts* may conflict with other files; therefore some 
problems may arise and the superuser must be aware of that.

When installing alternatives, *bb-alts* will remove all alternatives 
that are not listed in the configuration file and point to 
*/bin/busybox* or the other helper programs installed by the *bb-alts* 
package.

*bb-alts* will not install an utility when there is already another 
file in the corresponding location.

Before installing a new package that provides an executable file on the 
same location that a busybox alternative, the superuser must remove the 
conflicting alternatives.

On the other side, after removing a package that provides some utility 
that is also listed in */etc/bb-alts.conf* we must reconfigure 
*bb-alts*, that will install the corresponding alternatives activating 
the command from the *busybox* internal applet.
